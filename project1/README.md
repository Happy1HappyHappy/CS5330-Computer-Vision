# CS5330 Computer Vision - Project 1

## Overview
This project explores real-time video filtering and image processing techniques using OpenCV. It implements various filters and effects as detailed in the project report.

## Project Structure
- **`videoDisplay/`**: Contains the main application for real-time video filtering.
    - `src/`: Source code.
    - `include/`: Header files.
    - `Makefile`: Build script.
- **`imageDisplay/`**: Contains code for static image display tasks.
- **`Report.md`**: Detailed report of the project tasks, algorithms, and results.
- **`Assets/`**: Images and resources used in the report.

## How to Build and Run
The main application is located in the `videoDisplay` directory.

1. Navigate to the video display directory:
   ```bash
   cd videoDisplay
   ```

2. Compile the project using Make:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./bin/vidDisplay
   ```
