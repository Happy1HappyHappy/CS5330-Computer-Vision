# CS5330 Computer Vision

**Authors:** Claire Liu, Yu-Jing Wei

## Overview
This repository contains coursework and projects for **CS5330 Pattern Recognition & Computer Vision**. It serves as a collection of our implementations, experiments, and reports throughout the course.

The projects are primarily implemented in **C++** using **OpenCV**.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Real-time Video Processing & Depth Estimation](project1/)

    *   **Image Display:** Static image viewing utility.
    *   **Depth Anything V2:** Integration of the Depth Anything V2 model for monocular depth estimation.
*   **Documentation:** [See Project 1 README](project1/README.md)

## Tech Stack
*   **Language:** C++ (Standard C++17)
*   **Libraries:** OpenCV 4
*   **Build System:** Makefile
